# Commodity prices in relation with geographic data

## Statement of the problem
The price of commodities like electricity or food are usually determined by a great number of factors like weather, local policies, infrastructure, etc. It is reasonable to assume that neighboring places like for example adjacent states will have similar commodity prices, but when looking at the data some states fall out of this rule. So the question is, how can we make use of all the available data to infer which are the important variables in the determination of commodity prices?

## Outline of solution
- There is a great amount of information on databases and geographic Entities. First we have to identify the relevant variables.
- Measure what is the relation between the selected variables and the prices we are trying to predict.
- Find a way to classify the data and check if predictions about commodities prices can be made.
